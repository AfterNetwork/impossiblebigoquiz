## Requirements
```
The file, secretpass, has been left out of github because it contains the username and password for 

the email that's used to send forgotten passwords.  In the config file, there is a ternary operator 

that upon the env variable being undefined it willrequire ./secretpass.  This file will need to be made :

var passcode = 'smtps://hereyou'llputtheemailthatisused:andrightheregoesthepasswordfortheemail.gmail.com';

exports.passcode = passcode;

```
